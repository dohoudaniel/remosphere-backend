## 20th November 2025
- Successfully set up the users, authentication and categories app
- Successfully created superuser
- Created, set up and successfully migrated data models to Supabase
- User Information (using seeded data):
      1. POST request to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/token/` using the seeded Admin data returns the `access_token` and the `refresh_token`
      2. I used this same data to try fetching the job categories, and it worked.
      3. Let's make more progress.
